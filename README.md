Grocery optimization project that calculates the cheapest list of products from a safeway store that satisfy reasonable dietary requirements.
This project can dynamically fetch the store inventory of any safeway location and process the data with the usda food data central database to calculate the total nutrients in each project.
You can then run an optimization program that will calculate the best possible combination of products to satisfy some dietary constraints. The dietary constraints can be configured based on your body make-up, or customized for another reason.

Possible improvements: 
  support for more stores (this should be easy as their backends are very similar)
  better nutrient database (usda one is not always accurate, only has data for around 88% of the products, and doesn't have very many nutrients listed)
